#Find my Coffee

##Summary

**_Find my Coffee_** is an app that allows user to search for 10 coffee shops nearby their current location. It provides a map that will show the user their current location, search results and general information about the coffee shop.

This app can be modified to search for other places such as bank, gas station, restaurants, etc.

##Motivation

As a mom who is always on the go, I often find myself craving for coffee to get me through my busy schedule. I have tried brewing my own coffee at home and bringing it with me but I often forget to drink it or I would need another one to get me through the day. I wanted an app where I can look for a coffee shop where I can unwind real quick and get my coffee fix.


##API Reference

**_Find my coffee_** uses [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), which is an interactive map that is used to display on the web. It also utilizes [Geolocation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro) which is used to get user's current location.


##Known Issue

There's a delay in displaying the Google map.
Geolocation does not work on non-secure origin (http), click [geolocation](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/geolocation-on-secure-contexts-only) for more information.
